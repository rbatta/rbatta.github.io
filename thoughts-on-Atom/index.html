  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I want to take the time to give my opinion on Atom, the text editor. As a developer, I can choose between a plethora of options for text editors, including but not limited to vim, emacs, Sublime, and Atom. As a developer that prefers GUI and using a mouse, I&#39;m going to casually ignore any terminal(ly ill) related editors. Why? I think this sums it up pretty nicely:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'>Tweet could not be processed</div>

<p>Probably much like every Rails developer that taught themselves, I learned Rails using Sublime. And, quite frankly, Sublime is great! It has a ton of functionality, packages to add more functionality, and a fairly decent default colour scheme. But, teaching yourself how to learn how to install new packages for whatever new functionality was a pain in the butt.</p>

<p>Then came Atom. At first, I thought, &quot;Not <em>another</em> editor! What makes it so much better than Sublime??&quot; and thought nothing of it. I continued to use Sublime. But then I started to write a lot in Markdown. In particular, Github markdown because of support docs.</p>

<p>A colleague of mine mentioned an app that displayed a file in markdown, some app that started with a big teal M. I have no idea what it was, but having to use another app to view Markdown format was a pain.</p>

<p>Another colleague suggested Atom. Atom had this thing called &quot;Markdown preview&quot;, done with a keyboard shortcut of <code>cntl-shift-m</code>. Boom! To my left was my .md file I was working on and to my right was the preview version. Fantastic!</p>

<p>But, after my stint at that particular job was over, I stopped using Atom and went back to Sublime. It wasn&#39;t until about a month later when that very same colleague mentioned in a tweet that Atom had gotten to be considerably better than Sublime and that he himself completely switched. I decided to give Atom another go, mostly after Yet Another Popup(tm) happened on Sublime. (Yeah I didn&#39;t want to shell out $70 for it, mostly because I don&#39;t use all those packages they have.)</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked back. Admittedly I haven&#39;t really added extra functionality or anything; I&#39;ve added a few extra packages (such as particular syntax highlighting) and themes but outside of that, no major changes.  </p>

<p>Here are some of Atom&#39;s functionalities that I enjoy fully. It&#39;s the little things!</p>

<ul>
<li>I can change the theme and syntax highlighting super quickly and easily.</li>
<li>It tells me which branch I&#39;m currently on, how many package/theme updates are available, and if there&#39;s anything wrong with the editor (like something was deprecated) at the very bottom.</li>
<li>It changes the colours of my files in my document tree based on whether it&#39;s new or modified (this might be because of a theme, but I loooove it!)</li>
<li>Atom tells me how much added time a plugin or theme will cause Atom&#39;s startup time to slow down.</li>
<li>Adding new themes/plugins/functionality is super simple.</li>
<li>If writing in markdown, typing <code>code</code> then pressing tab autocompletes it to the ` triple tick marks, then you can add ruby to the end of that to get ruby syntax highlighting in your .md&#39;s.</li>
<li>Typing <code>pry</code> then hitting tab autocompletes it to <code>binding.pry</code></li>
<li>Markdown preview seriously needs a lot more love.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a heads up, I currently use One Dark / Seti as my theme/syntax highlight.</p>

<p>Note though, that the functionalities I was used to in Sublime still worked in Atom, and that was a huge relief and made the transition much smoother.</p>
