    <p>I used to be risk-averse. But now? Totally not. In fact, I may be ever so slightly an adrenaline junkie. And I love every bit of it.  </p>

<p>Maybe a few years ago I found a pair of <em>&quot;see the world thru the eyes of a 3 yr old&quot;</em> glasses, but ever since then, life is pretty awesome.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-am-i-excited?!">So why am I excited?!</h3>

<p>Because we&#39;re going on an <em>ADVENTURE</em>, Charlie! Yeah, Charlie, and adventure!</p>

<p>No really though. I love adventures. Everything is an adventure! It&#39;s totally not limited to going to new places. It&#39;s everything. Heck, every day is an adventure!</p>

<p>So really, why am I this excited?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to Vancouver, Canada for a month. Ok ok, it may not seem like such a big deal, but here&#39;s where it gets more interesting.<br>
1. I have never been to Vancouver.
1. Women&#39;s World Cup soccer games are there!
1. I&#39;m going to at least 4 Cup games!
1. I can work remotely anywhere I want!
1. Did I mention Women&#39;s World Cup soccer?
1. I&#39;m going to get me a Finals ticket, darn it.</p>

<p>So how did this all come to be? What made me decide to do something kinda crazy (for me)? Simple answer: The hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. I&#39;m scared to go! And that means that I&#39;ve got to do this. I can do this, and I&#39;m going to have a blast!</p>

<h3 id="no-really.">No really.</h3>

<p>In reality, I was talking about soccer in Slack with my team and realized that this year was Women&#39;s World Cup. I love watching soccer, and women&#39;s soccer is by far more entertaining than men&#39;s. Why? They don&#39;t flop about like wet fish on the field; they are a lot more brutal with their tackles; and Abby Wambach is the highest goal scorer (int&#39;l games) on the face of the planet at currently 178 goals. The closest man is Ali Daei at 105, for comparison. Just saying. On top of it, Men&#39;s World Cup is so much more expensive, and I have no desire to go to the next few countries for their Cup games.</p>

<p>On top of it, it&#39;s in Vancouver, just a short flight away! Because my job is already remote, I can even work from there. So I started calculating things out and decided that going for almost the entire month of June made sense. Financially, not really, but whatever. We&#39;ve only got this life, we might as well enjoy every bit of it!</p>

<p>It really helps that I&#39;ve no ties to SF. And maybe I&#39;ll end up falling in love with Vancouver and spend more time up there. Anything&#39;s possible.  (I still love you, SF. But y&#39;know. <em>You know why.</em>)</p>

<h3 id="what-about-your-birthday?">What about your birthday?</h3>

<p>Psh. GTFO. Birthdays ain&#39;t got nuttin&#39; on dis! Birthdays are just another day of disappointment for me -- I say this as my birthday is a few days away, and the disappointment is ever increasing.</p>

<h3 id="ahhhh!">AHHHH!</h3>

<p>Oh my effing gawd. I&#39;ve never been to a soccer match before! So many firsts! I&#39;m going to so many games! AHHHH. And I hear Vancouver is so pretty, and it&#39;s a walkable city! And all the nature trails! It&#39;s totally gay friendly too! You can&#39;t get any better than this right now for me!  Now to experience other new things outside of soccer!</p>

<p>...Secretly-not-so-secretly, I think that if I fall in love with this city and then some, I may spend more time up there. 2-3 months at a time! Geezus, I love working remotely.</p>

<p>How does one sleep with this excitement?!?</p>
