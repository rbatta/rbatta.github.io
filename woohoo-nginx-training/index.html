    <h1 class="post-title">Woohoo, Nginx training!</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Apr 7, 2015</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I freaking love San Francisco. Seriously. It&#39;s pretty much the center of everything tech related. And if it&#39;s not in the city, then it&#39;s in Silicon Valley, just a short trip away (depending on what time you leave).</p>

<p>I also secretly love Twitter. Why? Because every single conference, meetup, or event I&#39;ve wanted to attend has either been retweeted into my feed or has popped up as a suggested tweet / ad. Yeah, Twitter&#39;s algorithm is brilliant. Gotta hand it to them. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s any of this got to do with Nginx? Well the other day I tweeted about something I learned with Nginx and their location blocks. Not long after, when I was checking my feed, I saw a suggested ad/tweet thingy that said something about an Nginx User Summit and Training thing happening relatively soon and in SF. I clicked on it. Hold the phone. There&#39;s going to be a fundamentals of training course?! This is perfect! My coworker and I have been flailing our arms trying to learn and properly use Nginx for about a couple of weeks, and here there was a 1-day training being offered!</p>

<p>We spoke to the boss lady who immediately said yes and bought our tickets for us (early bird tix were about $145 incl silly service fees and taxes). We were off to training! Truth is, even if she didn&#39;t pay for it, I would have footed the bill because I saw that training to be crucial to my own success. Thankfully our boss is super awesome and encourages learning.</p>

<h3 id="training-day">Training Day</h3>

<p>The Summit/Training was held at RocketSpace in downtown SF. The space was really nice, and we were given a bunch of different swag (tees, water bottles, cute lil cars with M&amp;Ms in them, an O&#39;Reilly book about microservices, etc). The best part was the fact that the tables were lined with paper and had crayons. :D Oh yeah the 12-yr-old me was stoked!</p>

<p>Training started promptly at 9:30 and went over the basics of how to install and configure Nginx. We were all given AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean droplets to work with. My coworker and I lucked out with DO boxes (who needs some long URL to type in for ssh&#39;ing? Just give me a freaking IP!)</p>

<p>The pace was pretty good (admittedly a bit slow for my tastes) and was very comprehensive. It went over what each of the major blocks/contents and common directives were, how to set up SSL, how to set up multiple apps, load balancing, and how to act like a proxy server. All the things I needed to really learn were covered. Between each section was a 5-10min break for people to attempt the &#39;exercise&#39;, which was stepped thru by the instructor prior, so it wasn&#39;t anything extremely complicated.</p>

<p>I only really recall 2-3 Nginx folks walking around to check to see if anyone needed extra assistance, tho there were about 10-12 Nginx folks overall. The guys sitting across from us needed some assistance because their boxes didn&#39;t have port 8080 open (or listening, rather), which couldn&#39;t be resolved for whatever reason, even with a couple of Nginx folks helping out. </p>

<p>The final exercise was more complicated and right up my alley - a task to set up Nginx as backend and proxy servers, incorporating things we&#39;ve already learned as well as proxy caching. The answers are apparently going to be emailed to us later so I&#39;ll check against that once we receive it.</p>

<p>Once training was over, the lightning talks began. Admittedly, this was where my interest wained, tho the guy talking about load testing with a thing called Bees with Machine Guns was really cool. My coworker and I opted not to stay until the end for the social hour and excused ourselves. </p>

<h3 id="overall-thoughts">Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Seriously, this training was kind of amazingly perfect timing for my coworker and myself. Would I recommend it? Hellz yes! It&#39;s the perfect beginner course to anyone getting to know and understand Nginx. It&#39;s really simple to use, now that I understand it better. It was also validating to know that the things we were teaching ourselves by fiddling around with the servers were all correct.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always game on attending training of any sort. Really glad I was able to go to this particular one. I hope to attend more and different training courses.</p>
