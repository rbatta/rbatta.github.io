  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As always, a work story. Here at Team DevOps, we&#39;ve been tasked to create a couple of Rails apps using different Ruby versions. After all, why not? We&#39;re also Rails developers too, even if we don&#39;t look like it. Admittedly, it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve started a Rails app from scratch I almost forgot how to do <code>rails new</code>... Yeah, only slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more familiar with Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0.x than 2.2.x and 4.2.x, so I decided to make my app using the older versions. Of course, I&#39;ve since updated my rubies and rails versions, so without thinking much about it, I did <code>rails new</code>. Figured I could just bundle update when I switched ruby/rails versions.</p>

<p>Oh god, that was a terrible, TERRIBLE mistake.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.nicknotas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ive_Made_a_Huge_Mistake.jpg" alt="Huge mistake"></p>

<p>What got created was an awesomely standard Rails 4.2.0 app with Ruby 2.2.0. No problem. In my Gemfile I added in <code>ruby 2.0.0</code> and bundle updated and thought nothing of it. I moved on and edited my database.yml file and decided to add some of my standard gems I&#39;d be using for TDD: guard and spork. But since it was rails 4.2, I wasn&#39;t sure how my guard/spork setup would work, since I was plugging and chugging from an old 4.0.x app I had. Well, whatever.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just change rails 4.2.x to rails 4.0.x! No problemo!! Lemme bundle update and then run <code>guard init rspec</code>. </p>

<p><img src="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/897102/mushroom-cloud-o.gif" alt="Kaboom!"></p>

<p>What. Have. I. Done. Guard was complaining that I had started things up with a newer version so it wouldn&#39;t be able to use the version 4.0.13 wanted (2.6). Not only that but <code>rails g anything</code> wasn&#39;t working either. Geezus. So I completely uninstalled guard and then installed only the correct version, but even then the Guardfile created seemed weird. Rails didn&#39;t let me install rspec either without complaining. Not to mention Rake. Oy vey. How much had changed between Rails 4.0 and 4.2??! What is this business about <code>activejob_railties</code>??</p>

<p>OK, there were some major changes that I haven&#39;t really been paying attention to. ActiveJob was a new addition to 4.2. On top of that, the <code>config/initializers/application.rb</code> file format had changed from referencing the <code>AppName::Application...</code> to <code>Rails.application...</code> Then there were the additional railties that were added in. This is just the tip of the iceberg...</p>

<p>Yeah let&#39;s queue up the whole <code>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing</code> meme here. Seriously. At this point the only thing I could sensibly do was to completely start over and create a Rails 4.0.x app. But how would I do that?? </p>

<p>The Rails guides didn&#39;t have any indication on how to reference versions when creating it, so off to Google and StackOverflow.</p>

<h3 id="the-way-of-the-old-rails-warrior">The way of the old rails warrior</h3>

<p>I can just refer an older Rails version when doing <code>rails new</code>! Since I wanted 4.0.13, I did this: <code>rails 4.0.13 new appname</code>. This did not work.</p>

<p>My syntax was incorrect, and maybe I need rails 4.0.13 installed. I also wanted to build the app with ruby 2.0.0 so in the end these were the correct steps. (I use rbenv on my machine, and apparently didn&#39;t have gems for p643 so used p451.)</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv global 2.0.0-p451
<span class="nv">$ </span>gem install rails 4.0.13
<span class="nv">$ </span>rails _4.0.13_ new appname</code></pre></div>

<p>Please note the <code>_</code> surrounding the version. This is key! Once I did that and installed the app, everything was set properly. I created a rails 4.0.x app that was locked in with ruby 2.0.0. FINALLY. Bundle installed, set up guard and spork and rspec and I was on my merry way to coding heaven. I commited that sucker faster than a speeding bullet.</p>

<p>Now, how do I write new models again...?</p>
